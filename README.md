## 📖 Description
**Enchantments Encore** adds 140+ enchantments to the game which can be obtained in any vanilla way. Some are obtainable in loot chests or in an enchanting table, others are tradable at villager. Even mobs can spawn with some of the new enchantments on their equipment.

The datapack also adds a unique Structure which has always a guaranteed enchantment from this datapack in it.

## ⭐ Enchantments Overview

<br><br>
## 🛠️ How to, Instructions & Commands
The datapack usually just needs to be installed. There is nothing else you have to do. It just works out of the box.

But if you are playing on a PaperMC Server (or a PaperMC Fork like Purpur) make sure to set **allow-non-player-entities-on-scoreboards** in your paper config files to **true** in order for everything to work properly.
