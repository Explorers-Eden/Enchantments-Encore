## üìñ Description
**Enchantments Encore** adds a vast array of new enchantments to the game which can be obtained in any vanilla way. Some are obtainable in loot chests or in an enchanting table, others are tradable at villager. Even mobs can spawn with some of the new enchantments on their equipment.

The datapack also adds a unique Structure which has always a guaranteed enchantment from this data pack in it.

## ‚≠ê Enchantments Overview
A comprehensive overview of all enchantments and their infos can be found here: [Click Me!](https://enchantments.explorerseden.eu/)

Starting with v3.2 there also is an in-game wiki accessible via the pause menu to quickly check enchantments you don't know yet.

## ü§ù Data Pack & Mod Compabilities
Enchantments Encore is compatible with all Vanilla Enchantments as well as [NeoEnchant+](https://modrinth.com/datapack/neoenchant) and Enchantments of [Katters Structures](https://modrinth.com/datapack/katters-structures).

Any other enchantment data pack probably will also be compatible but most likely will not have mutual exclusivities to Enchantment Encores enchantments.

In addition to that the latest versions also support [Enchantment Descriptions](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchantment-descriptions) (Enchantments Encore v1.8+) and [Enchantment Lore](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchantment-lore) (Enchantments Encore v2.5+). If you're using the data pack version, make sure to use it also as a resource pack to make it work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Gibberish
The datapack usually just needs to be installed. There is nothing else you have to do. It just works out of the box. Starting with v3.0 **the data pack also functions as the resource pack** to make the new enchantments stand out more from the vanilla ones and also to provide the needed translations. *(Mod users automatically have the resources enabled)*

But if you are playing on a PaperMC Server (or a PaperMC Fork like Purpur) make sure to set **allow-non-player-entities-on-scoreboards** in your paper config files to **true** in order for everything to work properly.
